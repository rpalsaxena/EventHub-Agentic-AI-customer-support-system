    "The LangGraph workflow successfully orchestrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classifier Node** → Categorizes tickets (category, urgency, sentiment)\n",
    "2. **Tool Caller Node** → Fetches KB articles + user/reservation info (CultPass pattern)\n",
    "3. **Resolver Node** → Generates response using pre-fetched context\n",
    "4. **Router** → Decides resolved vs escalated (code-based rules)\n",
    "5. **Response/Escalation Node** → Finalizes output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- ✅ Deterministic tool calling (category-based, not LLM-decided)\n",
    "- ✅ Single LLM call per resolution attempt\n",
    "- ✅ Code-based escalation rules\n",
    "- ✅ Full context passed to human on escalation\n",
    "- ✅ RAG confidence tracking\n",
